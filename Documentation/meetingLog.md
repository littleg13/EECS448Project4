# Meeting Log

We primarily communicated using a Discord server and only had two formal
meetings. Since Discord is chat based, there are no specific times for
when Discord "meetings" occurred. In our Discord we also setup a
channel to alert all team members when someone commits to the Github repo.

### Daily Scrum
We made sure to communicate almost every day after lecture, even if only for a short time to keep everyone updated on what was going on and what we had to do.
